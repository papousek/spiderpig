# Welcome

**Spiderpig** is a library allowing you to structure your data analysis. It
provides a mechanism of injecting parameter values for specified functions from
a global context/configuration. It also introduces caching of executions of
functions without side effect based on values of its parameters and parameters
of dependent functions.
