**Spiderpig** is a library allowing you to structure your data analysis. It
provides a mechanism of injecting parameter values for specified functions from
a global context/configuration. It also introduces caching of executions of
functions without side effect based on values of its parameters and parameters
of dependent functions.

## Features
1. Organizes your code analysing data.
2. Makes one global configuration for all specified functions.
3. Caches time-expensive computations to save time.
